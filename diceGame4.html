<h1>Welcome to Yips!</h1>
  <p>Yips! is the dice-rolling virtual golf game that proves <br> even the best golfers can hit a shank or two.</p>
<h2>Rules:</h2>
  <p>Hit f12 on your keyboard to open the console and see what your total strokes are for each hole.</p>
  <p>No one can cheat! (since the dice are virtual that won't happen anyway)</p>
  <p>If comparing your score to a friend's, the lower total amount of strokes after 9 holes wins.</p>
  <p>Below are the club types to input. Each club represents a dice type.</p>
  <p>If you hit the ball over the hole, you remain at the same spot and try again until the distane to hole = 0</p>

<h2>Clubs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Driver: 200 - 10 yards.</li>
    <li>4 iron: 120 - 10 yards.</li>
    <li>Hybrid: 80 - 10 yards.</li>
    <li>7 iron: 60 - 10 yards.</li>
    <li>Wedge: 40 - 10 yards.</li>
    <li>Putter: 10 - 1 yards.</li>
  </ul>
