<h1>Welcome to Yips!</h1>
  <p>Yips! is the dice-rolling virtual golf game that proves <br> even the best golfers can hit a shank or two.</p>
<h2>Rules:</h2>
  <p>Hit f12 on your keyboard to open the console and see what your total strokes are for each hole.</p>
  <p>No one can cheat! (since the dice are virtual that won't happen)</p>
  <p>If comparing your score to a friend's, the lower total amount of strokes after 9 holes wins.</p>
  <p>If you hit the ball over the hole, you remain at the same spot and try again until the distane to hole = 0.</p>
  <p>Below are the club types to input. Each club represents a dice type, ranging from 20 sided to 4 sided dice.</p>


<h2>Clubs</h2>

    <li><strong>Driver</strong>: 200 - 10 yards.</li>
    <li><strong>4 iron</strong>: 120 - 10 yards.</li>
    <li><strong>Hybrid</strong>: 80 - 10 yards.</li>
